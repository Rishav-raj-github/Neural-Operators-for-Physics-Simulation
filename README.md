 Neural Operators for Physics Simulation

Train and analyze deep learning models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and physics simulations (e.g., climate, fluid dynamics) using NVIDIAâ€™s open-source NeMo toolkit.



 Description

This repository provides code, data, and guides to build, train, and evaluate neural operator models for numerical physics and scientific simulation. Neural operators aim to learn mappings between function spaces, enabling fast and accurate solutions for complex systems governed by PDEs.

**Core Focus:**
- Climate modeling (heat transfer, temperature, wind)
- Fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes, Darcy flow)
- Physics-driven ML with state-of-the-art architectures such as Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), DeepONet, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
